# Covid-19 Buddy
#### *Covid-19 Buddy* is an application created to help Covid-19 patients/victims at home, to take proper care of themselves.
 
 Developed by somebody who, at the time of writing this, is sick with Covid-19; I noticed a lack of online tools to support covid-19 victims.
 I encourage anyone who wants to build upon what I've done so far, to meet the goals stated below, making a critical tool for at-home covid-19 patients.
 
 ## App Goals
 * Assist users keep track of their temperature over time, utilizing various graphs
 * Provide users with tools/resources to reach out for mental health or medical support
 * Allow users to track their medication/dosage over time
 * Give users ability to track their symptoms over time, as well as their mental health
 * Provide users with their closest testing site, local health department resources, etc.
 * Automatically warn/prompt users if certain red flags arise from their entries (trouble breathing, high grade fever, suicidal thoughts, etc.); provide crisis hotlines
